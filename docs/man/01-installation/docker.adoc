Docker
------

Using {feelpp} inside
<<what-is-docker,Docker>> is the recommended and
fastest way to use {feelpp}. The
<<Docker,Docker chapter>> is dedicated to Docker
and <<feelpp-containers,{feelpp} containers chapter>> is dedicated to {feelpp} in Docker.

We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with
{feelpp} in particular as an end-user.

People who would like to develop with and in {feelpp} should
read through the remaining sections of this chapter.
