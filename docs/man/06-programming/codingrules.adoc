This is an overview of the coding conventions we use when writing {feelpp}
code.

== Clang Format

`clang-format` is a powerful tool to reformat your code according to
rules defined in a `.clang-format` file at the toplevel directory of
your software.

{feelpp} has such a file and define the indentation, space and breaks
rules defined later on.

For `clang-format` to function properly, follow the <<comments>> rules.

To apply {feelpp} rules on a file `a.cpp` in a {feelpp} sub-directory, type
----
clang-format a.cpp
----
to dump the results of the reformating to the standard output
or type
----
clang-format -i a.cpp
----
which will replace `a.cpp` by the reformated file.

WARNING: be careful when reformating, make sure nobody is working on that file, to avoid creating possibly massive conflicts with the persons currently modifying the same code when they get merged.

[[headers]]
== Header files and multiple inclusions

To avoid multiple inclusions, wrap every header files using the following technique

[source,cpp]
----
// say we have myheader.hpp
#if !defined(FEELPP_MYHEADER_HPP)
#define FEELPP_MYHEADER_HPP 1

// your header here...

#endif // FEELPP_MYHEADER_HPP
----

== Naming Convention

In {feelpp}, we basically follow the same naming conventions as in Qt and
KDE.

Class names starts with a capital. The rest is in camel case. Function
names starts with a lower case, but the first letter of each successive
word is capitalized.

Functions and classes should be in the `Feel` namespace.

The prefix `set` is used for setters, but the prefix `get` is not used
for accessors. Accessors are simply named with the name of the property
they access. The exception is for accessors of a boolean which may start
with the prefix `is`.

Acronyms are lowercased too. Example: Url instead of URL and
isFemEnabled() instead of isFEMEnabled()

Accessors should usually be const.

This example shows some possible functions names

[source,cpp]
----
class A
{
public:
    void setMatrix(const Matrix& c);
    Matrix matrix() const;
    void setDiagonal(bool b);
    bool isDiagonal() const;
};
----

[[reserved-identifiers]]
== Reserved identifiers

* Do not use underscores to start identifiers, see
link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228783/what-are-the-rules-about-using-an-underscore-in-a-c-identifier/228794#228797[StackOverFlow
comments here] for the reasons



== Indentation

* 4 spaces are used for indentation but not in namespace
* Spaces, not tabs!
* Suggestion: use emacs and [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/dirvars.el
dirvars.el], here is the content of `.emacs-dirvars` in top {feelpp}
directory
+
----
indent-tabs-mode: nil
tab-width: 4
c-basic-offset: 4
evaluate: (c-set-offset 'innamespace '0)
show-trailing-whitespace: t
indicate-empty-lines: t
evaluate: (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
----

[source,cpp]
----
namespace Feel
{
// no space indentation in namespace
Class A
{
    // 4 spaces indentation
    A() {}; 
    void f();
};
}
----

[[comments]]
== Comments

Use {cpp} style comment `//` rather than `/* */`. It uses less
characters but also it is easier to reflow using clang format.

[source,cpp]
----

/* Wrong
  the doc
  */

// Correct
// the doc
----

=== Doxygen

TIP: link:http://www.doxygen.org[Doxygen] is the tool to document {feelpp} and create a reference manual

Use `//!` to comment function, variables, classes rather than `/**
*/`, it allows to reflow comments using clang format.

[source,cpp]
----
//!
//! @brief the class
//! @author me <me@email>
//!
class TheClass
{
public:
  //! constructor
  TheClass() {}

private:
  //! member
  int member;
};

//! the function
void thefunction() {}
----

WARNING: {feelpp} used to promote `/** */` but this is no longer the case.
The comment style will be updated progressively to match the new style using `//!`

[[declvariables]]
== Declaring variables

* Declare each variable on a separate line
* Avoid short (e.g. `a`, `rbarr`, `nughdeget`) names whenever possible
* Single character variable names are only okay for counters and
temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious
* Wait when declaring a variable until it is needed

[source,cpp]
----
// Wrong
int a, b;
char __c, __d;

// Correct
int height;
int width;
char __nameOfThis;
char __nameOfThat;
----

* Variables and functions start with a lower-case letter. Each consecutive word in a variable's or function's name starts with an upper-case letter
 * Avoid abbreviations

[source,cpp]
----

// Wrong
short Cntr; char ITEM_DELIM = '';

// Correct
short counter; char itemDelimiter = '';

----

 * Classes always start with an upper-case letter.
 
[source,cpp]
----

// Wrong
class meshAdaptation {};

// Correct
class MeshAdaptation {};

----

 * Non-static data members name of structures and classes always start with `M_` . M stands for Member. The rational behind this is for example :
 ** to be able to immediately see that the data is a member of a class or a struct
 ** to easily search and query-replace
 
[source,cpp] 
----

// Wrong
class meshAdaptation { std::vector directions_; };

// Correct
class MeshAdaptation { std::vector M_directions; };

----

 * Static data members name of structures and classes always start with `S_` . `S` stands for Static. The rational behind this is for example :
 ** to be able to immediately see that the data is a static member of a class or a struct
 ** to easily search and query-replace

[source,cpp]   
----

// Wrong
class meshAdaptation { static std::vector directions_; };

// Correct
class MeshAdaptation { static std::vector S_directions; };

----

[[whitespace]]
== Whitespace

 * Use blank lines to group statements together where suited
 * Always use only one blank line
 * Always use a single space after a keyword and before a curly brace.

[source,cpp] 
----

// Correct
if (foo) { }

// Wrong
if(foo) { }
----

 * For pointers or references, always use a single space between the type and `*` or `&`, but no space between the `*` or `&` and the variable name.

[source,cpp]
----

char *x;
const std::string &myString;
const char * const y = "hello";

----

 * Surround binary operators with spaces.
 * No space after a cast.
 * Avoid C-style casts when possible.

[source,cpp] 
----

// Wrong
char* blockOfMemory = (char* ) malloc(data.size());

// Correct
char *blockOfMemory = reinterpret_cast(malloc(data.size()));

----

[[braces]]
== Braces

 * As a base rule, the left curly brace goes on the same line as the start of the statement:

[source,cpp]
----

// Wrong
if (codec) { }

// Correct
if (codec) { }

----

* Function implementations and class declarations always have the left brace on the start of a line:

[source,cpp] 
----

static void foo(int g) { std::cout << g << "" }

class Moo { };

----

* Use curly braces when the body of a conditional statement contains more than one line, and also if a single line statement is somewhat complex.

[source,cpp]
----
// Wrong
if (address.isEmpty()) { return false; }

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { std::cout << "i=" << i << ""; }

// Correct
if (address.isEmpty()) return false;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) std::cout << "=" << i << "";

----

* Exception 1: Use braces also if the parent statement covers several lines / wraps

[source,cpp] 
----
// Correct
if (address.isEmpty() || !isValid() || !codec)
{
    return false;
}

----

* Exception 2: Use braces also in if-then-else blocks where either the if-code or the else-code covers several lines

[source,cpp]
----
// Wrong
if (address.isEmpty())
  return false;
else
{
  std::cout << address << ""; ++it;
 }

// Correct
if (address.isEmpty())
{
    return false;
}
else
{
    std::cout << address << ""; ++it;
}

// Wrong
if (a) if (b) ... else ...

// Correct
if (a) { if (b) ... else ... }

----

* Use curly braces when the body of a conditional statement is empty

[source,cpp]
----

// Wrong
while (a);

// Correct
while (a) {}

----

[[parens]]
== Parentheses

 * Use parentheses to group expressions:

[source,cpp]
----

// Wrong
if (a && b || c)

// Correct
if ((a && b) || c)

// Wrong
a + b & c

// Correct
(a + b) & c

----

[[switch]]
== Switch statements

 * The case labels are in the same column as the switch
 * Every case must have a break (or return) statement at the end or a comment to indicate that there's intentionally no break, unless another case follows immediately.

[source,cpp] 
----
switch (myEnum)
{
  case Value1:
    doSomething();
    break;
  case Value2:
  case Value3:
    doSomethingElse(); // fall through
  default:
    defaultHandling();
    break;
}
----

[[breaks]]
== Line breaks

 * Keep lines shorter than 100 characters; insert breaks if necessary.
 * Commas go at the end of a broken line; operators start at the beginning of the new line. An operator at the end of the line is easy to not see if your editor is too narrow.

[source,cpp]
----
// Correct
if (longExpression + otherLongExpression + otherOtherLongExpression) { }

// Wrong
if (longExpression + otherLongExpression + otherOtherLongExpression) { }
----

[[inheritance]]
== Inheritance and the `virtual` keyword

When reimplementing a virtual method, do not put the `virtual` keyword in the header file.
