Visualizing functions over a mesh
---------------------------------

The next step is to visualize function over the mesh. The source code that generate our output is
available in link:../codes/05-myexporter.cpp[myexporter.cpp], presented in the previous section.



You can visualize data via :

- link::https://www.ceisoftware.com/[ensight]

- link::http://www.paraview.org/[paraview]

- link::http://geuz.org/gmsh[gmsh]

The results files are in

- `$HOME/feel/myexporter/np_1`

or

- `$FEELPP_WORKDIR/feel/myexporter/np_1`.

We discriminate output directories based on the name of the simulation
(the parameter `_name` in the environment), the number of process
(`mpirun -np ...`) and the type of the chosen exporter
