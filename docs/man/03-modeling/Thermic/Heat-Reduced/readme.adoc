= Reduced Basis

We are interested on applying the reduced basis method to the heat equation for the 3D benchmark.
$$
\rho c \partial_t T - k \Delta T = f(x,t,v)
$$
The parameter of interest is $v$, the velocity of the torch.
The output of interest is the mean temperature at each time.

To mimic the torch, we will use the link:../Heat-3D-1/readme.adoc[Goldak] function.

== Offline operations

- Construct an EIM approximation of $f(x,t,v)$ such that $$f_M(x,t,v) \approx \sum_{i=1}^M g_M(t,v)\xi(x)$$
- Construct the reduced basis 

== Oneline operations

- Evaluate the output
