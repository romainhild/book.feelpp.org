= Programming Syntax Quick Reference

One of Feel{plus}{plus} assets is it finite element embedded language. The
language follows the C++ grammar, and provides keywords as well as
operations between objects which are, mathematically, tensors of rank
0, 1 or 2.

In all following tables we use the notations:
stem:[f: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}]
with stem:[n=1,2,3], stem:[m=1,2,3], stem:[p=1,2,3].

We denote stem:[\Omega^e] current mesh element.

The genesis of the language can be found in cite:[prud2006domain].
