== Multiscale Image

in order to deal with large scale image, several tools have been
developed to facilitate access to images.

Denote stem:[f \in \mathbb{R}^N] where stem:[N] is the dimension of the
image stem:[N=N_x N_y] with stem:[N_x, N_y] are the number of pixels in
direction stem:[X] and stem:[Y] respectively. stem:[f] contains the pixel
value.

NOTE: define image format pending
NOTE: define transformation pending
