NAFEMS LE1 Benchmarck
======================

This benchmark is extract from the link:http://things.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/software/abaqus_docs/docs/v6.12/pdf_books/BENCHMARKS.pdf[Abaqus Benchmarks Manual].

== Definition

We focus on the link:http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le1.html[LE1] benchmarks in particular.

=== Geometry

The geometry is given link:http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le1.html[here] by : +

=== Boundary conditions

We set:

- stem:[u_y = 0] on DC
- stem:[u_x = 0] on AB
- stem:[\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}\cdot\mathbf{n}=1e^7] on BC.

== Inputs

We have the following parameters:

.Inputs
|===
| Name | Value

|stem:[E] | stem:[210\, GPa]
|stem:[\nu] | stem:[0.3]
|stem:[\rho] | stem:[7800\, kg/m^2]
|===

== Outputs

We want to compare the value of stem:[\sigma_{yy}] at the point D. The reference value is stem:[92.7\, MPa].

== Results

The value of stem:[\sigma_{yy}] at the point D is stem:[94.09\, MPa] for stem:[32 000] dofs, which is stem:[1.49%] higher than the target.

One possibility to get a more accurate output is to use a mixed formulation, where the stress tensor would also be an unknown.
