Computational solid mechanics ( or CSM ) is a part of mechanics that studies solid deformations or motions under applied forces or other parameters.


== Second Newton's law

The second Newton's law allows us to define the fundamental equation of the solid mechanic, as follows 

[stem]
++++
\rho^*_s \frac{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\eta}_s}{\partial t^2} - \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{F}_s\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s) = \boldsymbol{f}^t_s
++++

It's define here into a Lagrangian frame.

== Lamé coefficients 


The Lamé coefficients are deducing from the Young's modulus stem:[E_s] and the Poisson's ratio stem:[\nu_s] of the material we work on and can be express 

[stem]

\lambda_s = \frac{E_s\nu_s}{(1+\nu_s)(1-2\nu_s)}
\hspace{0.5 cm} 
,
\hspace{0.5 cm} 
\mu_s = \frac{E_s}{2(1+\nu_s)}

== Axisymmetric reduced model

We interest us here to a 1D reduced model, named _generalized string_.

The axisymmetric form, which will interest us here, is a tube of length stem:[L] and radius stem:[R_0]. It is oriented following the axis stem:[z] and stem:[r] represent the radial axis. The reduced domain, named stem:[\Omega_s^*] is represented by the dotted line. So the domain, where radial displacement stem:[\eta_s] is calculated, is stem:[\Omega_s^*=\lbrack0,L\rbrack].

We introduce then stem:[\Omega_s^{'*}], where we also need to estimate a radial displacement as before. The unique variance is this displacement direction.

The mathematical problem associated to this reduce model can be describe as 
[stem]
++++
 \rho^*_s h \frac{\partial^2 \eta_s}{\partial t^2} - k G_s h \frac{\partial^2 \eta_s}{\partial x^2} + \frac{E_s h}{1-\nu_s^2} \frac{\eta_s}{R_0^2} - \gamma_v \frac{\partial^3 \eta}{\partial x^2 \partial t} = f_s.
++++
 
where stem:[\eta_s], the radial displacement that satisfy this equation, stem:[k] is the Timoshenko's correction factor, and stem:[\gamma_v] is a viscoelasticity parameter. The material is defined by its density stem:[\rho_s^*], its Young's modulus stem:[E_s], its Poisson's ratio stem:[\nu_s] and its shear modulus stem:[G_s]

At the end, we take stem:[ \eta_s=0\text{ on }\partial\Omega_s^*] as a boundary condition, which will fixed the wall to its extremities.
